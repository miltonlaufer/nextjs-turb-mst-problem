## THIS IS A "FORK" FROM THE REPO LINKED BELOW JUST TO SHOW A PROBLEM WITH TURBOPACK AND MOBX-STATE-TREE

Steps:
1. Install all the packages (for example, `yarn`)
2. Run the default dev mode (`yarn dev`). It works.
3. Use the turbo mode (script `yarn dev-turbo`*). It doesn't work. 

* of course, this runs `next dev --turbo`.
